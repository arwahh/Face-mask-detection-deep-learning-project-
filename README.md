# Face-mask-detection-deep-learning-project-
This project is a Face Mask Detection System built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV.
It classifies whether a person is wearing a face mask or not by analyzing images.
The model is trained on labeled image data and tested on unseen images to ensure accurate predictions.
